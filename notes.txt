here I will compile all of my thoughts on react as I attempt to learn this trash

the key feature of react is that we can hide information and functionality from the user after they have already loaded the webpage, meaning once we have everything loaded from the server, we can use react to build an intuitive user interface that will never have to actually load  anything

why use react?
with normal JS you have to detail every single step that can be taken, react makes some assumptions about what should happene on elements, giving it some limitations, but ultimately accomplishes its goal of being a user interface

getting npm to work is a fucking nightmare, instead use nvm https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm and then use 'nvm install 16' to get the required versions

now run

npx create-react-app my-app

this will take a bit

but it should work

back to understanding react, remember, react is designed to run on the server in small easy snippets

node will install of your dependencies defined in  package.json and store them in the node_modules folder

any custom element that you build must be an uppercase character

in react the concept of parameters are generalized, their data is not interpreted upon passing, so it is often refered to as props

if you want to introduce an element that should be treated as a javascript expression rather than plain text, use "{}"
